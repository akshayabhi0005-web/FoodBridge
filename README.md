Turning Food Waste into Hope
🌱 FoodBridge – Turning Food Waste into Hope

FoodBridge is a modern, web-based platform designed to reduce food wastage by connecting food donors, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and volunteers through a single, user-friendly system. The platform enables real-time coordination for food donation, discovery, and delivery, ensuring surplus food reaches communities in need efficiently and safely.

The application features role-based access, allowing donors to list surplus food, NGOs to view and claim available donations, and volunteers to manage pickup and delivery tasks. A key highlight of FoodBridge is the integration of an AI-powered assistant, which provides real-time guidance, answers user queries, and enhances overall user experience.

FoodBridge also includes a real-time logistics map powered by Leaflet and OpenStreetMap, along with route navigation support using Google Maps, helping volunteers optimize delivery routes and reduce food spoilage. The platform supports multiple languages and is fully responsive, ensuring accessibility across devices and user groups.

This project demonstrates how modern web technologies and artificial intelligence can be effectively applied to solve real-world social challenges by promoting sustainability, reducing food waste, and supporting community welfare.
